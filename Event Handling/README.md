# Event Handling Practice

This project demonstrates how to handle different types of events in JavaScript. The webpage includes buttons that respond to `click`, `mouseover`, `mouseout`, and `dblclick` events. Each event triggers a different action, showcasing various event handling techniques.

## Features

- **Click Event**: Changes the button's color.
- **Mouseover Event**: Displays a message near the button.
- **Mouseout Event**: Hides the message when the mouse leaves the button.
- **Double-click Event**: Hides the button.

## HTML Structure

The HTML file includes:
- Three buttons with unique IDs (`button1`, `button2`, `button3`).
- Each button has an associated message `div` that is displayed or hidden based on user interaction.
